# Awm(All waste management)


***WCE Hackathon 2022***

Problem Statement ID: **PS06**
Problem Statement:  **E-waste management and disposal system using machine learning**


# PROBLEM STATEMENT REDEFINED:-  

Increase in E-waste in our nature leads to various problems and health hazards.

So, we the students of second year had tried to create a responsive E-commerce website where people can sell their E-waste. Yes we are trying to make people sell their waste product to those who can remanufacture it or to those can use it for their lab researches. For example:-

Mark is a person who owns a repair shop in his locality. He used to repair mobile phones of other people. He is always in the need of different parts of mobiles and laptops in cheap rates so that he can earn a good profit from it. Our aim is to make him happy by providing him broken phones and laptops (which are worth waste to general people) to him. By this both Mark and general people will earn money and it would turn as a economic boost to them. 

Taking all the things with regards to the market and what kind of people we should concentrate in!  We thought of focusing on Middle-class people. As for them rs. 10 is also valueable. So the product which is of no use to them, the product which they were considering a waste and are going to throw it in a dustbin, they will realise that they could sell that waste product and also earn some money.


This website consist of certain languages:-
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.Java Script 
4.Python


# Methodology:-

Basically in the website we will ask the user to create a profile and when he wants to sell his damaged products he has to made apply for it and has to send us the photos of damaged products so that we can verify it and we will be at his door offering them some money if we found that the product can be reused. Then after we will provide the same to those who will book that product by having our own margin between the transfer of products. Also we can ask people to recommend this website to other and we will give them points on the basis of their recommendation and also they will also get points when they give their products to us. And when they collect a particular number of point we will send them any voucher/ gift cards/ T-shirts etc. We will be generating a proper amount of margin so that we can pay the transfer charges to the workers. And we can also create another method of generating money by showing some advertisements to the people before they can apply form their products to be reviewed.

# FLOWCHART OF THE WEBSITE

# Future endeavours

We plan to incorporate a feature where right from the household itself waste can be segregated into what type of waste it is Plastic,E-waste,Bio-degradable etc.
When the user clicks teh photo of that waste our ML Model identifies the type of waste & then Using Sensors we will open the lid to that bin only.From this right from the begning the waset will be segregated & then the user can use our website to sell their E-waste. We also plan to add a feature of giving cryptocurrency to user's as a reward for using our portal right from waste segregation till waste dump. Basically more the user uses our portal we will reward him/her up & give him.m/her bitcoins & other cryptocurrency hence making the user to use our portal more & more and also helping in protecting mother nature.

# WASTE CLASSIFIER( not incorporated in website as of now but fully working code of the ML Model ):- 

Other module of waste segregation (not incorporated in website as of now but fully working code) 
We developed a ML Model that will develop a classifier to seperate waste into six classes : glass, paper, cardboard, plastic, metal, and trash based on their images.
Automatically classifying the types of waste would effectively :

*be an aid to the domestic sorting of waste
*allow for a verification system at the time of waste collection
*be integrated into sorting machines in recycling plants
*Reduce toxic waste ending in landfills
